# Abstract
Memorization is a key cognitive process in the learning content. A course with difficult memory tasks can provoke a cognitive overload and frustration in a group of learners, also with easy memory tasks can evoke low cognitive load and boredom, both cases with poor learning outcomes. But first, the cognitive load must be measured to be controlled in learning courses in a non-invasive way avoiding distractions --e.g. remote eye-trackers. In eye-tracking studies, there are no cognitive load or memory task difficulty classifiers. We propose a classifier of working memory task difficulty based on cognitive load characteristics with pupil size data using remote eye-tracker. For this, we made a data analysis of pupil data from three memorization tasks with easy, medium, high difficulty, selecting the features with significant differences and training the most accurate classifiers used in eye-tracking research as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF).
